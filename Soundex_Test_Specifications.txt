Test Steps:
1. Setup: Initialize the test case with an empty string as input.
2. Execution: Call the generateSoundex function with the empty string as its argument.
3. Verification: Check if the output of the generateSoundex function matches the expected output, which is also an empty string.
Expected Results: The function generateSoundex should return an empty string when given an empty string as input.
